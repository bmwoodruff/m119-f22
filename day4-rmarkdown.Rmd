```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## My First Section

Let's make a coding chunk that let's me compute the values of a function. 

```{r}
f <- function(x){8*x^2-5}
```

Now that the function is defined, we can compute $f(-2)$ and $f(1)$. 

```{r}
f(-2)
f(1)
```

We obtain $f(-2) = `r f(-2)`$ and  $f(1) = `r f(1)`$. This is an example of how to include computations inline when you are writing.
